# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems; having solved these smaller problems should contribute to solving the original problem. Those type of problems would be best suited to be solved utilizing recursion.

Every recursive problem needs a 'base case' , a condition that will allow the recursion to stop running when encountered. Having a base case provides the simplest instance of a problem which is leveraged as the stopping point because it can no longer be simplified anymore. You use this smaller straight forward solution to solve your more bigger more complex instances.

You can solve problems more efficiently with recursion in different ways 

Divide and conquer 
- breaking the problem into a smaller more manageable smaller problems
that eventually can lead back to the original.
example is in an array where we can split down the middle and apply a recursive function on each half thus speeding up the process not to get confused with just being a log n level because of the we split it.

log n is associated when there are problem size reduction or halves at EACH step. For example if we just constantly split and apply recursive code on each run it would be log(n) but if we added say a merge-o(n) the problem becomes a o(n log n) time. Merge is o(n) because it is based off the amount of elements being processed and log n being the constant splitting. 

# Teacher Feedback
While your answer is fundamentally correct, it could be enriched by mentioning specific types of recursive problems such as divide-and-conquer strategies and *how* recursion simplifies complex problems by reducing them to base cases. It can help to include specific examples like calculating factorial, Fibonacci numbers, and parsing nested structures.
