# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems; having solved these smaller problems should contribute to solving the original problem. Those type of problems would be best suited to be solved utilizing recursion.

# Teacher Feedback
While your answer is fundamentally correct, it could be enriched by mentioning specific types of recursive problems such as divide-and-conquer strategies and *how* recursion simplifies complex problems by reducing them to base cases. It can help to include specific examples like calculating factorial, Fibonacci numbers, and parsing nested structures.
