# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its definition. The first case that exist within a recursive function is the base case - An instance of the problem that can be addressed without the need for recursion.
Next up is the recursive case, where the function calls itself with adjusted arguments to break down the problem into simpler versions. These simpler versions are eventually solved by the base case. 


//adjusting the arguments to work towards the base case.
