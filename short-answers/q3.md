# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
The benefit to writing functions recursively is that a recursive function solves a problem by calling itself with adjusted arguments, progressively solving simpler instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case. AKA making solutions to problems more automated since it allows for the "self-solving" function to run instead of us having to manually code.

Drawbacks
Recursion uses more memory because each function call adds a new layer to the call stack as it keeps on stacking it could lead to a overflow error. It can also be slower, so recursion should be used only when it makes logical sense for the problem at hand.

Revision Additions
Recursion makes solving complex much simpler by breaking the problem into smaller similar problems, for example with the tree and graph traversals , recursion lets me handle each part of the tree in the same way ensuring reliability and simplier code. You could write out one piece of code to solve a problem by having it be recursive rather than hard code 10 lines doing the same thing. ( use the same method over and over by design, reducing the amount of work for developer.)


Downsides

When using recursion, call stack  keeps track of each function call. Each time a function calls itself it adds a new layer of stack. 

If there are too many function calls stacked up (recursion infinite loop or is too long for it to be viable ), the call stack can have a overflow of stacked calls hence stack overflow. It happens when the stack is full that and can no longer handle any more function calls, leading to a crash or errors.

# Teacher Feedback
~~While the general benefit of automation is mentioned, adding that recursion often leads to cleaner and more readable code when dealing with complex algorithms (like those in tree and graph traversals) could enhance your response.~~

~~Phrases like "overflow error" and "call stack" are correctly used, but a brief explanation of these terms and how they connect with recursive function calls and "stack overflows" can strengthen your argument as well. ~~

You got it!!!
