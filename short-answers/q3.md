# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
The benefit to writing functions recursively is that a recursive function solves a problem by calling itself with adjusted arguments, progressively solving simpler instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case. AKA making solutions to problems more automated since it allows for the "self-solving" function to run instead of us having to manually code.

Drawbacks
Recursion uses more memory because each function call adds a new layer to the call stack as it keeps on stacking it could lead to a overflow error. It can also be slower, so recursion should be used only when it makes logical sense for the problem at hand.

# Teacher Feedback
While the general benefit of automation is mentioned, adding that recursion often leads to cleaner and more readable code when dealing with complex algorithms (like those in tree and graph traversals) could enhance your response.

Phrases like "overflow error" and "call stack" are correctly used, but a brief explanation of these terms and how they connect with recursive function calls and "stack overflows" can strengthen your argument as well.
